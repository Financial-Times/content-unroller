In the US, the economic downturn was the deepest since 1945 and the longest since the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>The US economy had made back that lost ground by 2011, but knock-on sovereign debt crises in the eurozone would delay many European economies’ recovery — and for some, the ground has still not been made up. Unemployment in Greece remains at 23 per cent, some 15 percentage points higher than in 2007.</p>\n<p>Stock markets in most countries have powered to new highs, in part thanks to the monetary stimulus that central banks used to try to pull their economies — and their housing markets — back to health, but the next chapter, in which that stimulus will be removed, is yet to be written.</p>\n<ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet\" url=\"http://api-t.ft.com/content/b9ab6946-a9dd-358a-87ce-ea432ed8bc33\" data-embedded=\"true\"></ft-content>\n</body>",
