    <p>Theresa May triggered a two-year countdown to Britain’s breach with Europe on Wednesday by serving notice to Brussels that she intends to end their 44-year relationship in pursuit of a new place for the UK in the global order. </p>\n

    <p>“This is a historic moment from which there can be no turning back,” she declared.</p>\n

    <p>Mrs May invoked the EU’s

    </p>\n

    <p>The six-page letter was seen in European capitals as broadly conciliatory and flexible, but Mrs May also conveyed a tough warning that EU security would be “weakened” if Britain left the bloc without a new comprehensive deal with Brussels.</p>\n

    <p>Mrs May’s stated desire for a “deep and special partnership” combined with a veiled threat that a complete break from Europe could harm EU security was reinforced by Amber Rudd, the home secretary, who noted Britain was the biggest contributor to Europol, the EU crime-fighting body. “If we left, we’d take our information with us,” she said.</p>\n

    <p>European capitals largely chose to focus on the conciliatory tone of most of the letter and Mrs May’s address to parliament, delivered just as her missive reached Mr Tusk’s hands.</p>\n

    <p>The presentation of the exit letter — the first occasion in the EU’s 60-year history that a full member state has chosen to leave the bloc — was at first greeted with dark humour from Mr Tusk: “After nine months, the UK has delivered.” </p>\n

    <p>Later he offered a more sombre assessment: “As for now, nothing has changed. EU law will continue to apply to and within the UK. We already miss you, thank you and goodbye.”</p>\n

    <p>But the government’s approach drew some criticism at home. Nick Macpherson, the former Treasury permanent secretary, tweeted: “Crime and terrorism don’t respect borders. It is not a credible threat to link co-operation to a trade deal.”</p>\n

    <p>Most European diplomats were less critical, arguing that Mrs May was simply trying to use Britain’s so-called “security surplus” to bolster a meagre negotiating hand.</p>\n

    <p>“They have two forms of leverage: money and security,” said one EU diplomat. “They weren’t going to offer large sums of money in the letter so the language on security was to be expected.”</p>\n

    <p>The British prime minister called the activation of Article 50 a “great turning point in our national story” but her remarks to the House of Commons also marked a shift to a softer tone. Mrs May promised to approach talks in a spirit of “respectful, sincere co-operation”.</p>\n

    <p>Mrs May also called for early technical talks on a “bold and ambitious free trade agreement” that would cover financial services, including new mechanisms to create a level regulatory playing field between the UK and EU. </p>\n

    <p>
        <a href="https://www.ft.com/theresa-may" title="Theresa May">Mrs May</a> said she wanted to end the role of the European Court of Justice in setting British law but has left open the possibility of some kind of ECJ role in policing issues such as trade disputes and arguments over regulatory divergence.

    </p>\n

    <p>The prime minister also hinted it might not be possible to nail down a final agreement on a trade deal within two years, saying it was vital that business should not be presented with a “cliff-edge” upon Brexit in 2019.</p>\n

    <p>In a shift in language, Mrs May acknowledged that the UK would pay a price for Brexit. “We know we will lose influence over the rules that affect the European economy,” she wrote. It was effectively a plea to EU leaders not to “punish” Britain twice.</p>\n

    <p>Germany said the negotiations would not be easy for either side. Chancellor Angela Merkel took a

    </p>\n

    <p>“Only when these questions are cleared up can we subsequently — but hopefully soon — talk about our future relationship,” she said in speech in Berlin. Ms Merkel’s stance is at odds with Mrs May, who wants to agree the terms of Britain’s future partnership with Europe “alongside those of our withdrawal”.</p>\n

    <p>David Davis, Brexit secretary, defended holding so-called “parallel talks” on Wednesday morning, telling Sky News: “Article 50 says the departure should be negotiated taking into account the ongoing deal. It is pretty plain that they have got to be done together.</p>\n

    <p>“We think that is a smart way to do it,” he added.</p>\n

    <p>Lars Loekke Rasmussen, Denmark’s premier, said he expected “many bumps on the road” during the talks, saying Britain’s decision to leave will have consequences. “Rights and responsibilities go hand in hand in the EU. You cannot have one without the other.”</p>\n

    <p>The prime minister of Croatia — the last country to join the EU, in 2013 — said Brexit was a “big, huge mistake” with negative consequences that will be felt primarily in Britain. Andrej Plenkovic said “no one can tell at this moment” when the negotiation would end, and what kind of agreement it would produce.</p>\n
